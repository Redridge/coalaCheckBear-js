    Today we will talk about Coala an open source code analysis tool.
Coala is basically an API that will allow you to write and use static code
analysis modules without worrying about the interface and generally any
usability issue. In order to use coala read on.

    If you are a user, install coala using pip and afterwards prepare a project
that you would like to have tested. Run all the checks using the --save option 
such that you won't need to do that in the future again. Now you can execute
again all the checks by running Coala.

    In case you are a developer, you need to write a Bear. You can find plenty
in the Coala-bears package if you want examples. A Coala Bear will yield the
results of its analysis in Result and Diff objects.

    That's it for the short introduction to coala. Cya
